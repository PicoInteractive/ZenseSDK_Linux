# ZenseSDK_Linux
**For Ubuntu 14.04.**

This is the Linux SDK for the Pico Zense TOF RGBD Camera (DCAM710), for the Ubuntu 14.04 distribution. 

The DCAM710 is a standalone 3D camera hardware module, developed by Pico Interactive, Inc., that uses time-of-flight (TOF) technology to capture depth information while recording imagery. The DCAM710 is packaged in a small form factor and can adapt to a wide range of environments while providing high-precision depth information.

The Linux SDK is built and tested on Ubuntu Linux. Each SDK is functionally the same but linked against appropriate system libraries. Versions for particular Ubuntu LTS distributions are in their own branch:

- [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_Linux/tree/Ubuntu18.04)
- [Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_Linux/tree/Ubuntu16.04)
- [Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/PicoInteractive/ZenseSDK_Linux/tree/Ubuntu14.04)
